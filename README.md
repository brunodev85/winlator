# Useful Tips

- If you are experiencing performance issues, try changing the Box64 preset to `Performance` in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
- For applications that use .NET Framework, try installing `Wine Mono` found in Start Menu -> System Tools -> Installers.
- If some older games don't open, try adding the environment variable `MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003` in Container Settings -> Environment Variables.
- Try running the games using the shortcut on the Winlator home screen, there you can define individual settings for each game.
- To display low resolution games correctly, try to enabling the `Force Fullscreen` option in the shortcut settings.
- To improve stability in games that uses Unity Engine, try changing the Box64 preset to `Stability` or in the shortcut settings add the exec argument `-force-gfx-direct`.
